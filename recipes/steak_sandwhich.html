    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 lb Beef Steak</li>
        <li>1/2 lb sliced onion</li>
        <li>2 Ciabatta Buns</li>
        <li>1/2 lb Grape Tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tsp Oregano</li>
        <li>100g Boccocini Cheese</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Balsamic Vinegar</li>
        <li>4 tbsp Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Before starting, preheat your broiler to high/low. 
            Wash and dry all produce. In Step 5, use this garlic
             guide to determine what garlic level you prefer: 1/4 
             tsp mild, 1/2 tsp medium and 1 tsp extra! Heat a large 
             non-stick pan over medium heat. When the pan, add 1 
             tbsp oil (dbl for 4 ppl), then onions. Cook, stirring 
             occasionally, until slightly softened, 3-4 min. Add 1 
             tsp sugar (dbl for 4 ppl) and season with salt. Cook, 
             stirring occasionally, until onions are golden-brown, 
             6-8 min.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Meanwhile, halve tomatoes. Roughly chop 1 tbsp oregano 
            (dbl for 4 ppl). Toss together tomatoes, oregano, 1 tbsp 
            vinegar and 1 tbsp oil (dbl both for 4ppl) in a large bowl.
             Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.</li>
        <br>
        <li>
            When onions are done, remove the pan from heat. Stir in remaining 
            vinegar, until onions are coated, 1 min. Transfer caramelized 
            onions to a small bowl. Set aside. Carefully wipe the pan clean.
             On a clean cutting board, pat steak dry with paper towel, then 
             season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Heat the same pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add 1 tbsp oil 
            (dbl for 4 ppl), then steak. Pan-fry, until cooked to desired doneness,
             4-6 min per side. ** When steak is done, remove pan from heat. 
             Transfer steak to a plate. Loosely cover with foil and set aside to 
             rest, 3-5 min.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Meanwhile, peel, then mince or grate garlic. Stir together mayo and 1/4 
            tsp minced garlic in another small bowl. (NOTE: Reference garlic guide.)
             Set aside. Halve ciabatta buns. On a baking sheet, arrange ciabatta halves, 
             cut side up and brush each half with 1 tsp oil. Toast in middle of oven, 
             until golden-brown, 2-3 min. (TIP: Keep an eye on your ciabatta so that 
             it doesn't burn!)</li>
             <br>
        <li>Thinly slice steak. Spread garlic-mayo over toasted ciabatta halves, then 
            top with steak and caramelized onions. Divide open-faced sandwiches between
             plates and serve with marinated tomatoes on the side. Tear bocconcini into 
             bite-sized pieces over tomatoes, then season with salt and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
